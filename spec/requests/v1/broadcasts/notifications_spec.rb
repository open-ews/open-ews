RSpec.resource "Notifications" do
  explanation <<~HEREDOC
    The **Notifications API** allows you to view and analyze the individual notifications that are sent to beneficiaries as part of a broadcast.

    A **Notification** represents a planned message to a single beneficiary, linked to a specific **Broadcast**. Each Notification may have one or more attempts, which track the actual transmission process.

    This API provides endpoints to:

    - **List notifications** associated with a specific broadcast.
    - **Retrieve statistics** for all notifications under a broadcast, such as:
      - Delivery success rate
      - Number of attempts
      - Time to delivery

    This API is ideal for implementers who need visibility into message distribution, system performance, and delivery outcomes at the individual recipient level.

      explanation <<~HEREDOC
        This endpoint provides statistical insights into the notifications under a broadcast managed within the OpenEWS system. This endpoint is particularly useful for generating reports, analyzing notification data, and monitoring the scope of your early warning system.

        ### Functionality

        This endpoint returns aggregated statistics about the notifications under a broadcast in your system. Common use cases include:

        - Counting the total number of notifications.
        - Grouping notifications by beneficiary's attributes such as location or gender.
        - Identifying trends or patterns in notification data.

        ### Parameters

        The endpoint may accept query parameters to filter or group the data. Common parameters include:

        - **Filters:** Specify conditions for narrowing down the results. For example, you might filter notifications by a specific status or beneficiary's fields.
        - **Group By:** Group the statistics by a particular attribute such as `status`, or beneficiary's fields.
